### OpenSearch
notes:
***ETL*** stands for **extract**, **transform**, **load** is a three-phase process where data is first extracted then transformed (cleaned, sanitized, scrubbed) and finally loaded into an output data container. The data can be collated from one or more sources and it can also be outputted to one or more destinations.

Big data **ingestion** gathers data and brings it into a data processing system where it can be stored, analyzed, and accessed. Data processing systems can include data lakes, databases, and search engines. Usually, this data is unstructured, comes from multiple sources, and exists in diverse formats.
